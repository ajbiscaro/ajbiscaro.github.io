Hello! My name is Ardel John Biscaro and I live in Baguio City, Philippines. I work currently for National Economic and Development Authority-CAR by day. And on my spare times, I do freelance web development projects,  play NBA2k game,  watch sports games especially basketball and boxing, read articles on web development,  current events and interesting historical events. 

I am happily married and have a child. I am a Seventh-day Adventist Christian and graduated from Northern Luzon Adventist College with a degree on Information and Computer Science.

I built web application using PHP with CodeIgniter framework, MySQL , Ajax and JQuery.  And used Wordpress, HTML5, CSS, JQuery in the development of websites. I passionately code websites and web apps to be simple, clean and conform to standards.  I am an advocate of minimalist website design.
